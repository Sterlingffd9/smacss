<p>The oak tree has been a standard tree that has been part of the American society for centuries. 
In 2004, the oak tree was named America’s
National Tree. Oak trees can live for over 200 years and have provided lumber and food for 
various forms of wildlife. Most people point to 
the oak tree as producing some of the most 
beautiful fall colors. There are nearly 90 species 
of oak trees found in the United States. Mexico has over 160 oak species, while China has the second greatest oak diversity and contains approximately 100 species.</p><p>There are two main groups of oak trees: white oaks and red oaks. These types of oaks are 
tdistinguished by the characteristics of the leaves and acorns, and in how long it takes the acorns to reach maturity. Red oaks produce leaves that are lobed and come to a point, which is different than white oak leaves where they come to a round end.Oak trees produce both male and female flowers on the same tree. The acorns are 
considered the “fruit” of the tree and consist 
of a rounded nut nested inside a scaly cup, 
knownas a cupule.  </p> </section>

<p> Oak seedlings sprout from the acorns that fall
 from the ground in autumn. Acorns often freeze before they can send roots down into the soil.This site has been created to bring awareness to the importance of oak trees in our world so that we continue to appreciate and protect them. “Over 5,000 species of insects, 58 species of reptiles and amphibians, 105 species of mammals and over 150 species of birds rely on oaks for some 
of their life cycle. If the oaks are gone, so are these associated species.” </p></section>
